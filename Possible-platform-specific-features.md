Xbox III and VC:
- ~~screen droplets (aap)~~, what about blood? (TAG?)
- cutscene hands (aap or Fire_Head)
- particles (probably Fire_Head)
- make custom pipes work with new renderer (and port to re3)
- menu? probably not though

Xbox vehicle pipe:
- render less expensive and better env map
- possibly even a sphere map

Mobile:
- matfx maybe?
